## ðŸ’¬ 3. **Behavioral Patterns** â†’ _How objects communicate_

Focus on interactions between objects.  
**Best study order:**

1. **Strategy** â€“ interchangeable algorithms
    
2. **Observer** â€“ one-to-many notification
    
3. **Command** â€“ encapsulate actions as objects
    
4. **Iterator** â€“ sequentially access collections
    
5. **State** â€“ behavior changes with state
    
6. **Mediator**, **Chain of Responsibility**, **Template Method**, **Visitor**
    

ðŸ§  These define _communication and flexibility_ between parts.
