## 🏗 2. **Structural Patterns** → _How objects are composed_

Focus on organizing classes and objects to form larger structures.  
**Best study order:**

1. **Adapter** – convert one interface to another
    
2. **Decorator** – add functionality dynamically
    
3. **Composite** – treat groups of objects as one
    
4. **Facade** – provide a simplified interface
    
5. **Proxy** – act as a placeholder or controller
    
6. _(Optional: Bridge, Flyweight — for more advanced systems)_
    

🧠 These make your code _modular and scalable_.
