## 🧱 1. **Creational Patterns** → _How objects are created_

Help you control **object creation** to make code flexible and decoupled.  
**Best study order:**

1. **Singleton** – one instance only
    
2. **Factory Method** – object creation via a factory
    
3. **Abstract Factory** – families of related factories
    
4. **Builder** – step-by-step object construction
    
5. **Prototype** – cloning existing objects
    

🧠 These are foundational — they explain “how to make objects correctly.”
